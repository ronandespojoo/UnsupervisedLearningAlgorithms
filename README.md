# UnsupervisedLearningAlgorithms
Uses Wine dataset. Applies KMeans, DBSCAN, PCA and KMeans Mini-Batching. Quantitative evaluation of silhouette score, Calinski-Harabasz and Davies-Bouldin Indices alongside Runtime Efficiency.

Code Objectives include applying KMeans clustering and using results-based evaluation in order to determine the optimal number of clusters; DBSCAN implementation for density-based clustering and anomaly identification; and PCA to reduce dimensionality. KMeans Mini-Batching is implemented in order to compare its efficiency against standard KMeans in comparing the accuracy and computational speed between the two methods.
